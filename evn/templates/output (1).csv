During the conversation he was heard informing the other end that he would now discontinue talking on the Mobile number in use and would again talk to him in about 30 minutes but using a new Mobile number. The said unknown Muslim youth who seemed to be suspicious was noticed loitering and talking on mobile in the area for about half an hour in the said locality. When the local Muslims of the area noted him they grew suspicious and confronted him and asked him about his identity, reason for his presence in the area.
